# 💡 AI-Powered Business Idea Stress Test
## A one-stop tool to evaluate the viability, risk, and profitability of startup ideas — before investing time, energy, or money.

## 👩🏻‍💻 Project Overview
Over the past few months, I’ve been working on a personal passion project: an AI-powered platform that stress tests business ideas — giving aspiring entrepreneurs a data-driven way to validate their concepts.

This platform combines natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and financial risk modeling into a seamless web app built in Streamlit.

It’s not just about analyzing ideas — it’s about helping founders make smarter, faster, and more informed decisions at the earliest stage.

## 🔍 Features (Live Now)
✅ AI-Based Sentiment Analysis
→ Evaluates the emotional tone and confidence behind a business idea

✅ Entity Extraction
→ Uses spaCy to pull out key business components (market, product, audience)

✅ Risk Assessment Simulation
→ Monte Carlo-style financial forecasting to simulate profit variability

✅ Streamlit Web App
→ Fully functional and user-friendly interface for testing ideas instantly

## 🧠 Built With

NLP & Entity Extraction	spaCy, Transformers
Sentiment Analysis	Hugging Face, VADER, TextBlob
Risk Modeling	NumPy, Pandas, custom simulations
Web Framework	Streamlit
Visualization (Upcoming)	Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🧪 Features In Progress
🚧 Downloadable Idea Reports — export insights as CSV/PDF
🚧 Financial Visualizations — graphs for break-even, profit bands, and risk zones
🚧 Idea History & Comparison — save multiple ideas and compare them side-by-side
🚧 Competitive Landscape — auto-generate a list of top competitors in the domain

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Enter your business idea in plain English

2. The app processes it using AI/NLP tools

3. It extracts key terms, analyzes sentiment, and runs financial simulations

4.You'll get an overall "stress score" along with breakdowns for:

    -Clarity

    -Risk

    -Innovation

    -Financial health

    -Market potential

## ✨ Why This Matters
Too many ideas fail because they’re never properly validated. This tool brings AI + business thinking together to de-risk early innovation — especially useful for founders in emerging markets like India.
